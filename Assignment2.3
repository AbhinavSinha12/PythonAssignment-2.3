Assignment 2.3
Implement a function longestWord() that takes a list of words and returns the longest one.

def longestWord(listWords):
    #initialise the longWord
    longWord =""
    #iterate over the listWords
    for word in listWords:
        #if the length is greater reassign to longWord
        if len(word) > len(longWord):
            longWord = word
    return longWord

print(longestWord(["abhinav","sinha","abra-ca-dabra"]))

#Output
abra-ca-dabra
